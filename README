NAME
    Software::License::DWTFYWWI - The "Do Whatever The Fuck You Want With
    It" license

DESCRIPTION
    The DWTFYWWI license is a way to effectively place your software into
    the public domain, but in a humorous way.

    If you want something with more legal backing you might want to use the
    "public domain"-like CC0 license instead, or maybe The MIT (X11)
    License.

AUTHOR
    The author of this package and of the DWTFYWWI license itself is Ævar
